# mqtt-smartthings-devices

Repo for my mqtt enabled SmartThings virtual devices.

You'll need to use this: https://github.com/stjohnjohnson/smartthings-mqtt-bridge in order to enable communication between SmartThings and mqtt. Then this device handlers can be used to send/receive commands and status from a physical device through MQTT and the bridge.
